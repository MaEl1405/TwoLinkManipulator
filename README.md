# Two-Link Manipulator Simulation

This project provides a simulation of a two-link planar robotic manipulator using Python and matplotlib.

## Description

The Two-Link Manipulator class simulates the motion of a two-link robotic arm in a 2D plane. It allows users to specify the lengths of the two links and the rotation angles of the joints. The simulation calculates the forward kinematics of the manipulator and visualizes its motion using matplotlib.
